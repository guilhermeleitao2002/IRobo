# Mobile Robot Localization Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on mobile robot localization using the TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi, exploring practical aspects of robotic self-localization through two primary Bayesian filtering techniques.

## Hardware Setup

- **Robot**: TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi
- **Sensors**: 
  - Onboard laser scanner
  - IMU
  - Odometry sensors
- **Processor**: Raspberry Pi running ROS drivers
- **Communication**: WiFi between robot and external computer

## Localization Techniques

### 1. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Localization
- Implemented using ROS `robot_localization` package
- Estimates robot position and orientation
- Uses odometry and IMU measurements
- Integrates ground truth data at 1 Hz
- Visualizes provided environmental map

### 2. Monte Carlo Localization (MCL)
- Implemented using ROS `amcl` package
- Uses laser scanner and odometry readings
- Creates and utilizes environment map generated by `gmapping`
- Supports both dataset and real-world robot testing

## Key Components

- ROS Packages:
  - `robot_localization`
  - `gmapping`
  - `amcl`
- Visualization in RVIZ
- Manual robot teleoperation for path exploration

## Objectives

- Understand practical mobile robot localization
- Implement Bayesian filtering techniques
- Explore localization uncertainty
- Experiment with different parameter configurations

## Experimental Goals

- Generate and compare maps
- Visualize estimated robot paths
- Analyze localization accuracy
- Investigate the impact of different parameter settings on localization performance
